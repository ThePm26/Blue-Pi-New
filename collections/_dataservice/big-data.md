## What We Do with Big Data

### Data Ingestion Pipeline
Every data journey begins with collecting the data from multiple sources coming in varied formats. All organizations are nowadays trying to collect data from multiple different systems all scattered in multiple places. We help you agglomerate this dispersed data and data sources by building an ingestion tier using well designed pipelines tailored for your needs. We use open source frameworks like Spark, Storm, Flink, Kafka that gives us flexibility to design the solution without any constraints, deployable in any Cloud or even On-Prem.

###  Realtime Analytics
Business mostly now want to reach a point where they have access to data at realtime/near real time, so that they can act upon it. For example in logistics any delay happening in packages if not identified and resolved soon will cause unnecessary delays and thus losses. Our technical expertise and solutions gives you the capability to deploy solutions that complete the journey of data to insights on the Dashboards in seconds. Thus giving businesses an edge to act instantaneously.

###  Batch Analytics
In the era of real time streaming, there are tasks that are time consuming and requires time. For creating customer 360 degree/single customer view where every user in records is analyzed for the entirety of the duration when he is active. These tasks which require heavier processing compute and longer time are executed in a batch mode at defined frequency. We at BluePi design scalable and cost effective solutions for such heavy lifting.

###  Data Lake
Businesses today hold data in multiple different sources and structures. Every business unit operating within an organization has its own source of truth to its own independent analytics leading to discrepancies between the functions. We at BluePi solve this problem by collating all these sources with different structures and formats into a single destination and creating a single source of truth for all the business functions. Our business oriented approach of carefully designing the datalake helps Businesses achieve their desirable outcome in a short span of time.

###  Data Warehouse
Data exposure in the form of various metrics and KPIs has become extremely important to function business based on the actual data. To serve this requirement it is extremely important that the data for reporting is structured in the most optimal way that data extraction is easy and speed of reporting is acceptable. Our Datawarehouse OLAP models are built and tailored to the business requirement. Our extensive discovery sessions with the Business help devise a clear roadmap to reach the end outcome of driving decisions basis the data.

###  Data Visualization
