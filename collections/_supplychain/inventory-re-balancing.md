Do you have inventory at one store while a much higher rate of sale in the other? And thousands of SKUs across hundreds of stores compound the problem even further? The problem can be exacerbate by excess reorder while demand could be fulfilled by just moving stocks from one store to another. While the customer demand at each store is independent of each other lack of proper stocks means unmet sales and lost revenue opportunities.
