The engine supports rich calculations to help users derive insights which are valuable and from the analytics reports generated users don&rsquo;t need to worry about provisioning or managing infrastructure. The SPICE engine automatically replicates data for high availability thus enabling QuickSight to scale to thousands of users who can all simultaneously perform fast interactive analysis.
