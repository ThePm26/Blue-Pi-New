# How Cloud Computing Benefits Your Business
## Do you ever wonder where does your email client save all your communication data ???

All right! Despite the rage Cloud Computing has become over a period of time, a lot of people working in the virtual marketplace still can't stop themselves from making weird faces like <em>Leonard Shelby&mdash;</em>suffering from memory loss in the movie <em>Memento&mdash;</em>every time the topic of the <em>cloud computing </em>crops up during business meetings. So to understand its positive impact on your business, you must first gain an insight into what it really means to have cloud computing services.

To put it in simple words, cloud computing is an Internet based software system that people can use without having to install it on their systems. This means employees of some company can have easy access to some application on the go using internet. For example, email communication.

Webmail clients use cloud computing services to store your data on the cloud and provide you quick access to your emails from any part of the world anytime.
But, is this the only enough reason for businesses to go crazy about the Cloud like they are high on <em>meth</em>? Let's find out here&mdash;straightaway.

## Fastest Way to Meet Business Demands
According to a survey carried out by a business magazine in the United States, as many as 66% of respondents wished to take their businesses to the cloud owing to its ability to meet business demands faster than other available alternatives. The exponentially growing competition in the industry is forcing companies to opt for more bandwidth than generally required, which only a cloud service provider can meet at the snap of fingers through its service's remote servers.

## No Need for Crucial Disaster Recovery
A cloud service provider not only helps you meet your business goals faster, but also prepares crucial disaster recovery plans for your business. This means you can focus on other key aspects of your business without having to worry about the loss of data. According to reports carried out by Aberdeen Group, companies using cloud services resolve their issues in as little as 2.1 hours while companies not using cloud services take over 8 hours to get to the bottom of a particular situation. This is a huge difference of approximately 4 hours.

## No Need for Software Maintenance
