# Public Cloud Adoption Challenges
<p> Unlike the private cloud, the public cloud enables enterprises to store data and run applications without buying, installing and maintaining servers and other equipment. Many organizations prefer <a href="https://www.bluepiit.com/blog/private-cloud-vs-public-cloud/">public cloud over the private cloud </a> to save cost by availing a multi-tenant environment. The multi-tenant environment requires enterprises to store storage space and computing resources with other tenants. The enterprises must explore ways to store data securely and utilize resources optimally while adopting and implementing public cloud. They also need to address a number of public cloud adoption and implementation challenges to optimize resource utilization and reduce cloud cost. </p>
<h2> Understanding Common Public Cloud Adoption and Implementation Challenges </h2>
<p><b> Deciding the Right Cloud Migration Approach</b></p>
<p> An enterprise can move its apps and data to a public cloud platform in a number of ways. Some enterprises reskill and retain their existing employees to manage the entire <a href="https://www.bluepiit.com/migration"> cloud migration service </a> process in-house. At the same time, many enterprises also opt for managed cloud services to simplify and accelerate cloud migration by resolving common challenges and issues. But no organization can change the approach halfway through the migration process. Many organizations find it challenging to decide the right approach to adopt a public cloud. </p>
<p><b> Reducing Cloud Migration Time </b></p>
<p> The number of enterprises moving their applications and data to the public cloud has been increasing steadily. But no organization can migrate its apps and data to the cloud in a short amount of time. The cloud migration time differs according to the amount of data and complexity of the software to be moved. The time required to complete the transition to the public cloud may exceed one calendar year. Hence, enterprises have to explore ways to curtail cloud migration time. </p>
<p><b> Reskilling and Upskilling Internal Teams </b></p>
<p> The public cloud platforms help businesses to run apps and store data without building and maintaining on-premise IT infrastructure. But organizations have to reskill and retrain their existing teams to facilitate cloud migration and adoption. Often the internal teams like the skill and expertise required to leverage the public cloud fully. The enterprises often find it challenging to train and prepare their existing employees to handle the transition to the public cloud. </p>
<p><b> Keeping Applications and Data Secured </b></p>
<p> As noted earlier, the public cloud platform requires businesses to store data and run applications in a multi-tenant environment. Hence, it becomes essential for enterprises to address common security issues and challenges before adopting the public cloud. Also, they need to implement a robust security policy to monitor security measures and prevent emerging security threats. They also need to ensure that both corporate and customer data are stored in a secured and protected environment. </p>
<p><b> Eliminating Downtime and Disruptions </b></p>
<p> The leading public cloud platforms promise optimal cloud platform to subscribers. But the enterprises must remember that not cloud service provider can eliminate chances of data centers is going down. The data centers can even go down due to both human errors and natural disasters. In addition to assessing the reliability and availability of the public cloud platform, the organizations must check to keep in place a robust plan to minimize disruption and downtime. They can even take advantage of the options provided by the cloud platform to deliver data and apps despite such disruptions. </p>
<p><b> Overcoming Differences in Data Law </b></p>
<p> The leading public <a href="https://www.bluepiit.com/migration"> cloud service providers </a> store digital data in data centers located in various geographical locations. The laws and regulations related to digital data storage and access differ from one country to another. When the digital data is stored on a server that is located in a foreign country, the enterprises cannot keep the corporate and customer data inaccessible. There are also chances that the public cloud service provider will make the data available to the government without seeking permission from the tenant. </p>
<p><b> Controlling Bandwidth Cost </b></p>
<p> The public cloud platforms help enterprises to curtail the cost of building and maintaining on-premise IT infrastructure. But the enterprises need adequate bandwidth to run applications and accelerate data transmission in the cloud optimally. The data-intensive applications even require additional bandwidth to deliver optimal user experience in the cloud. Hence, businesses have to incur recurring expenses to boost bandwidth and internet speed. The enterprises have to explore ways to speed up data transmission and optimize application performance without increasing bandwidth cost.</p>
<p> On the whole, each enterprise needs to address a number of challenges to adopt and implement public cloud successfully. It even needs to implement a robust strategy to monitor cloud resource utilization and data security consistently. Many enterprises even avail managed cloud services to resolve these common challenges in public cloud adoption and implementation. </p>
