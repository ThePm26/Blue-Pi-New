# What is Managed Cloud as a Service?
<p> While adopting <a href="https://www.bluepiit.com/migration">cloud migration service </a>, an enterprise has the option to avail IT services through a number of cloud service delivery models &ndash; Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). Likewise, a business can choose from three distinct types of cloud deployment models &ndash; private cloud, public cloud, and hybrid cloud. Unlike a public cloud, private cloud requires businesses to maintain, manage, and update their data centers by deploying dedicated administrators. </p>
<p> That is why; a number of studies suggest a surge in use of cloud management platforms and managed cloud services. Also, many enterprises nowadays prefer managed cloud to unmanaged cloud to run their applications efficiently in the cloud without maintaining and managing the virtual IT infrastructure. At the same time, a large percentage of enterprises implement and manage the cloud services efficiently by opting for a specialized cloud service model &ndash; Managed Cloud as a Service (MCaaS). </p>
<p> Unlike other cloud service delivery models, MCaaS enables businesses to implement and manage cloud services through the cloud vendor. The cloud vendor form partnership with third-party vendors to manage varying cloud services by creating cloud-based software solutions and packages. In addition to extending conventional cloud service delivery models, MCaaS also helps enterprises to avail high-quality cloud services by providing additional computing resources and prompt technical support.</p>
<h2> Understanding Important Aspects of Managed Cloud as a Service (MCaaS) </h2>
<p><b> A Specialized Cloud Delivery Model </b></p>
<p> The enterprises have the option to choose from a number of specialized variants of cloud service delivery models. MCaaS is one of the specialized cloud service delivery models. Like other cloud delivery models, MCaaS also enables enterprises to avail computing resources on demand. But the specialized cloud delivery model makes it easier for enterprises to leverage a variety of cloud services without focusing on implementation and management.</p>
<p><b> Extend Other Cloud Computing Models </b></p>
<p> The conventional cloud delivery models enable businesses to run applications and store data without building on-premise IT infrastructure. But no enterprise can leverage cloud services fully without managing them efficiently. Like other cloud delivery models, MCaaS also enables enterprises to outsource hardware operations. But MCaaS helps enterprises to extend other cloud delivery models by outsourcing cloud services management and support. </p>
<p><b> Outsourced Cloud Service Management </b></p>
<p> An enterprise can opt for IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS to avail the required computing resources without investing in specific hardware and software components. The cloud computing models even help businesses to run applications smoothly without focusing on hardware operations. MCaaS, as a specialized cloud delivery model, enables enterprises to get the cloud services implemented and managed by the cloud vendors. Many enterprises opt for MCaaS to implement and manage cloud services efficiently by overcoming constraints related to skills and resources. </p>

<p> Many enterprise application software providers nowadays form the partnership with managed cloud service providers to deliver their software products as customized cloud services. They leverage the MCaaS model to allow partners to customize the software products according to the precise needs of individual organizations. The partners can further improve the quality of the customized cloud services by allocating adequate computing resources and providing proactive technical support. Many enterprises opt for managed cloud services to avail high quality and customized cloud services according to their precise needs. </p>
<p><b> Increase in Cloud Adoption Cost </b></p>
<p> Many enterprises adopt cloud computing to run applications and store data efficiently without building and maintaining on-premise IT infrastructure. But they have to deploy skilled cloud engineers and incur additional expenses to manage the cloud services efficiently. MCaaS helps developers to implement and manage cloud services efficiently without incurring additional expenses. But an enterprise has to incur additional expenses when it opts for MCaaS. MCaaS still helps businesses to get more ROI in the long run by availing customized cloud services and leveraging cloud delivery models. </p>
