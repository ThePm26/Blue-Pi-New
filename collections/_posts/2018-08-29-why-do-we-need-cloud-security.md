# Why Do We Need Cloud Security?
<p> The number of enterprises migrating their applications and data to the cloud has been increasing consistently. A number of studies suggest that the cloud platforms provide enterprises with a more secure outlet for storing applications and data. But no enterprise can leverage the benefits of cloud computing without ensuring the security of its software applications and data. They need robust security solutions that meet the frequency and speed of cloud deployment. Also, they must leverage the latest security tools and implement advanced security protocols to eliminate the disastrous impact of targeted security attacks. There are also a number of reasons why enterprises must focus extensively on cloud security. </p>
<h2> 7 Reasons Why Cloud Security is Crucial for Each Enterprise </h2>
<p><br></p>
<p><b> 1. Growing Instances of Security Breaches </b></p>
<p> The instances of security breaches have been increasing exponentially. Some security breaches compel enterprises to disable their websites and mobile apps temporarily, whereas others make companies lose a significant percentage of their annual turnover. No enterprise can combat emerging data breaches and cybersecurity issues without implementing a robust cloud security strategy.</p>
<p><b> 2. Security Options Differ from One Cloud Service Provider to Another </b></p>
<p> Each <a href="https://www.bluepiit.com/migration">cloud service provider</a> promises enterprises to keep their applications and data secured. The large cloud service providers deploy dedicated teams to implement and monitor cloud security. But there are a number of cloud service providers who maintain and monitor cloud security through third-party security firms. Hence, the quality and effectiveness of cloud security implementation and monitoring differ from one cloud service providers. The enterprises must evaluate the security tools and protocols used by the service provider to prevent targeted security attacks.</p>
<p><b> 3. Many Factors affect the Data Storage Location </b></p>
<p>The cloud service providers normally store all data of an enterprise in multi-regional storage. The multi-regional storage system stores data in multiple geographic locations. Hence, enterprises often find it difficult to know where their data are stored and how the data are separated from other data. The cloud data access, storage, and security regulations further differ from one region to another. Hence, it becomes essential for enterprises to choose the most secure cloud storage option and monitor the cloud security strategy consistently.</p>
<p><b> 4. Enterprises Must Prevent Unauthorized Data Access </b></p>
<p> An enterprise can move both corporate and customer data to the cloud to enable employees to access the data anytime and anywhere. But no enterprise can keep the data secured without preventing unauthorized data access. They must implement a robust policy to define data access rules and roles clearly. They also need to implement multiple levels of authentication and authorization to make sensitive data accessible only to selected employees. The security roles will also help enterprises to keep the data stored in the cloud secured in the long run.</p>
<p><b> 5. Enterprises Must Eliminate Chances of Data Loss </b></p>
<p> When an enterprise opts for cloud storage, it needs to move both corporate and customer data to remote servers. The data stored on remote servers can be lost due to a number of sudden and unexpected events. The enterprises need to ensure that the data stored in the cloud are duplicated and backup at frequent intervals. At the same time, they must keep an elaborate disaster recovery strategy in place to recover all data each time any damage is caused to the primary data storage location. The data security and backup strategies must be integrated to eliminate chances of data loss. </p>
<p><b> 6. Meeting Cloud Deployment Frequency and Speed </b></p>
<p> Many enterprises nowadays develop, test, and run software applications in the cloud. The developers even deploy software builds frequently to the cloud. The enterprises cannot protect their software applications without detecting and repairing vulnerabilities during the development, testing, and production process. They must leverage the latest security tools and solution to scan the software build throughout the deployment process. They even need to update the security tools according to the speed and frequency of cloud deployment. </p>
<p><b> 7. Enterprises cannot Transfer Risk related to Data Loss and Theft </b></p>
<p> While opting for cloud computing, many entrepreneurs believe that the cloud service provider will compensate for data loss and theft. But the terms of the agreement restricts and minimizes the liabilities of the cloud service provider. Hence, the enterprise still remains responsible and liable for losses related to data loss or theft. The enterprises must implement a robust cloud security strategy to eliminate the risks associated with data loss or theft.</p>
<p>On the whole, the enterprises must focus extensively on security while migrating their software applications and data to the cloud platforms. In addition to picking a reliable and secure cloud platform, it is also important for businesses to assess cloud security consistently. They can even avail the assistance of managed cloud service providers to keep the security tools and protocols up-to-date according to frequency and speed of cloud deployment.</p>
