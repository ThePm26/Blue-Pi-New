# Why Performance Parameter Matters in Cloud Computing
The decision, to whether move your Organization&rsquo;s IT to the Cloud is difficult and requires a lot of Research. If you are the CEO of the company, then the probable answers you are looking at is &ldquo;why so much hype about the Cloud&rdquo;. According to a research done by Forrester, a leading market research company, the forecast for the global cloud industry is bullish. The Global Business spend for cloud will reach $191 billion by the end of 2020 from $72 billion in 2014. The current market scenario is such that the cloud industry has entered into a Hyper Growth stage and is displacing the on-premise setups faster than expected.
But with the Global Cloud market entering such unprecedented growth, it becomes vital for organizations to look for <a href="https://www.bluepiit.com/">Cloud service providers</a> who are into the business for the past many years. Not only this but the services should be such that it should easily fit with the Organization&rsquo;s long-term goals and should provide assistance whenever and wherever needed.
Some of the prominent cloud performance parameters which companies should look after before selecting a cloud service provider are:
## Flexibility:
This should be the most prominent factor in choosing a Cloud service provider for any company. Flexibility means that migrating legacy applications to the cloud becomes easy and should be very cost-effective. The cloud service provider should have flexibility in terms of programming models, operating systems, databases and architectures with which the organization is already familiar with. This enables organizations to mix and match architectures in order to serve their diverse businesses.
Moreover, this helps in reducing the time that it takes to adopt new technologies thus, giving your business a better opportunity to launch early. When the opportunity to innovate arises, you want to be able to move quickly and not always have to support legacy infrastructure and applications or deal with protracted procurement processes.
## Scalability &amp; Elasticity:
<a href="https://www.bluepiit.com/blog/on-demand-scalability-one-of-the-pre-dominant-advantages-of-cloud-migration/">Scalability (One of the predominant advantages of Cloud Migration!)</a> and Elasticity are often considered to be the major reason for the rise in the investment and infrastructure. In the cloud, the scalability and elasticity help not only in reducing the overall costs but also giving a better performance. The term elastic in terms of Cloud is defined as the ability to scale computing resources up and down easily, with minimal friction. It helps you avoid provisioning of resources up front for projects with variable consumption rates or short lifetimes. Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling can automatically scale your cloud-based resources up to meet unexpected demand and then scale those resources down as demand decreases.
## Cost-effectiveness:
<a href="https://www.bluepiit.com/migration">Cost Optimization</a> is one of the most complex elements of delivering contemporary IT solutions. Companies should select a Cloud service provider that has a feature of Pay only what you use, without any up-front, hidden costs and also should not have any long-term commitments. Cloud has a very distinct advantage in terms of Infrastructure as compared to contemporary infrastructure resources. It lets you consume only those amounts of resources that you actually need, thus, not limiting you to a set of storage, bandwidth or computing resources. The cloud provides the flexibility to strike the right balance so that you get the maximum benefit from your resources and get a higher ROI. You can start through a completely self-service experience online, scale up and down as needed.
## Experienced Cloud service provider:
You should be very careful in terms of choosing a <a href="https://www.bluepiit.com/migration">Cloud service provider</a>. If you have heard a lot of positive things about a particular cloud service provider but the service provider is new to the market and doesn&rsquo;t have a large client base, then it&rsquo;s always best to look for service providers who are into the business for a long time and have a good hold in the market. You should hold your cloud-computing partner to the same high standards that you would expect from any hardware or software vendor. The trust that you place in your cloud-computing vendor will be critical as your organization grows and your customers continue to expect the best experience.
## Security &amp; Recovery:
For leading organizations, having end-to-end security and end-to-end privacy is vital. Cloud service providers should follow the best security practices and should provide appropriate security features in those services. Detailed documentation on how to use those features should also be provided by the Cloud service provider so that it becomes easier to understand. At the end ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your company data should be of the utmost importance to the cloud service provider.
You should check with the cloud service provider that what backup systems they have in place if there is a major failure in their infrastructure? How long your data will be stored in the backup storage pace once the data is lost? When data in cloud face errors and failures or data are lost for any reason, the time required for data retrieval? and volumes of data which are recoverable, will be effective in cloud performance?
For example, if the data recovery takes a long time will be effective on cloud performance and customer satisfaction, because most organizations are cloud users and have quick access to their data and their services are very important for them
## Conclusion:
Companies always think of different ways of reducing the IT costs.<a href="https://www.bluepiit.com/blog/how-cloud-computing-benefits-your-business/"> Migrating your legacy infrastructure to the cloud is by far the most effective way</a> for optimal utilization of resources and to increase your profits. But before <a href="https://www.bluepiit.com/migration">migrating to the cloud</a> you should always know what parameters to looking for in an effective cloud service provider. The above-mentioned parameters are some of the critical performance parameters that you should definitely look for but should not limit to this only. Some of the other parameters that you can look into:

<li>
<strong>Location:</strong> Location of the data centers and their distance from a user&rsquo;s location can be a critical factor for the efficacy of the performance of the cloud.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> Fault tolerance is a concern for deploying critical services as well as application execution. It is concerned with all the techniques necessary to enable a system to tolerate software faults remaining in the system after the deployment of the software.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Storage &amp; Buffer Capacity:</strong> Physical memory of the Cloud infrastructure where all the data of the organization plays a critical role in terms of evaluating the cloud service provider. Buffer capacity of the infrastructure should also be evaluated so that even if there is a sudden surge of demand or if the allocated storage capacity falls short then the buffer space should automatically take over.
