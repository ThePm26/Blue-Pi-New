# Cloud Optimization
<p> Based on its computing resource requirements, an enterprise has the option to choose from different types of cloud computing &ndash; Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). But no enterprise can leverage the benefits of cloud computing fully without improving cloud efficiency. Like other smart entrepreneurs, you must implement a number of cloud optimization techniques to improve application performance and control cloud cost. </p>
<h2>7 Simple Tricks to Optimize Your Cloud </h2>
<p><b> 1. Evaluate Additional Features and Applications </b></p>
<p> The leading cloud service providers deploy new features and launch new cloud services at regular intervals. Often enterprises opt for these additional or new services to improve cloud performance. But you must remember that the additional features and services may impact cloud performance and cost adversely. It is always important to evaluate the additional services and their impact on cloud performance.</p>
<p><b> 2. Opt for Cloud Auto-scaling </b></p>
<p> The cloud service providers enable you to avail storage space and computing resources on demand. But you still need to ensure that the cloud resources are scaled according to current needs of individual applications. The auto-scaling option provided by the cloud platforms enable you to make the adequate resource available to each application proactively. You even have the option to specify the minimum and maximum sizes of instance pool as well as the scaling metrics. </p>
<p><b> 3. Focus on Managing Instances </b></p>
<p> While migrating your applications to the cloud, you need to decide the size of the virtual server instances. You even have the option to increase the size of virtual server instances in future according to change in requirements. But you cannot improve cloud efficiency without focusing on the management of instances. It is always important to reduce unused instance capacity by defining both rules and metrics.  </p>
<p><b>4. Opt for New Cloud Deployment Models </b></p>
<p> The leading cloud service providers regularly launch new cloud deployment models. The new cloud deployment models aim to simplify cloud migration and optimize cloud performance. You must consider switching to the new cloud infrastructures to run the applications more efficiently. For instance, while deploying a web application or mobile app in the cloud you can improve user experience by leveraging content delivery networks.</p>
<p><b> 5. Take Advantage of Latest WANOP Systems </b></p>
<p> The new age WANOP systems come with the enhanced capability to support cloud-based applications. You can use the latest WANOP systems as a virtual service to optimize both traffic and bandwidth by aggregating links. These systems can be further embedded into the cloud platforms seamlessly. You even have the option to manage traffic flow form distributed data traffics by implementing customized load balancing policies. </p>
<p><b> 6. Don&rsquo;t Forget to Optimize Cloud Storage </b></p>
<p> While exploring ways to improve cloud efficiency, you must not forget to optimize cloud storage. The optimization will help you to manage and control large volumes of data collected from varied sources. It is always important to create multiple data tiers and store the incoming data to the relevant data tier. However, it is also important to distribute the workload between spinning disks and flash to improve data storage and control. </p>
<p><b> 7. Leverage Cloud Optimization Tools and Services </b></p>
<p> You cannot optimize the cloud without monitoring cloud performance. There are a number of tools that help you to monitor and assess cloud performance. You must take advantage of robust tools to optimize cloud performance by taking the right decision at the right time. Alternatively, you can even avail the specialized services provided by managed cloud service providers to make the cloud perform optimally in the long run. </p>
<p> You have to invest time, resources, and fund to migrate your applications and data to the cloud successfully. These cloud optimization techniques will help you to increase higher return on investment (ROI) over a longer period of time. Also, you can improve the performance of your applications in the long run by optimizing your cloud usage. </p>
