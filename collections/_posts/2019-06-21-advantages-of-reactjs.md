# Advantages of ReactJS
 ReactJS is an open source JavaScript library which is developed by Facebook. At present, React is being maintained by Facebook and Instagram along with an open source community. The features provided by ReactJS enable developers to create interactive and compelling user interfaces (UIs) for varied websites and web applications. The lightweight JavaScript library accelerates UI development by enabling developers to build reusable UI components. At the same time, the developers can also use ReactJS to handle the view layer of various web applications and mobile apps. 
 Many developers even integrate React with other JavaScript web frameworks to create robust websites. They even take advantage of the JavaScript library to create single page applications (SPAs) that deliver updated information to end users without reloading the web pages fully. The usage statistics posted on various websites depict that a large percentage of developers prefer ReactJS to other widely used frontends web frameworks like AngularJS and Vue.js. ReactJS comes with a set of features that make it more popular than other JavaScript web frameworks. 

##  Why Developers Prefer ReactJS to Other JavaScript Web Frameworks? </h2>
**Simplifies Complex UI Development** 
 React enables developers to build complex UIs by integrating reusable components. It even helps programmers to write custom components according to precise project needs. Hence, the developers can easily simplify complex UIs by keeping them modular and composable. The can extend and update the web application simply by making changes to specific components. They can even take advantage of the Pros to create components based on customs data and pass custom data to specific components. 
 **Uses JSX instead of JavaScript**
 ReactJS enables developers to create templates using both JavaScript XML (JSX) and regular JavaScript. JSX enables programmers to render UI components by combining HTML and JavaScript. In addition to rendering UI component using HTML tag syntaxes, JSX also supports HTML quoting. Hence, it becomes easier for developers to create and render subcomonents using HTML syntaxes that can be easily converted into JavaScript calls by React. 
 **Supports Unidirectional Data Binding** 
 Unlike other JavaScript frameworks, ReactJS does not support two-way data binding. Instead, it supports unidirectional data flow. The feature enables web developers to pass properties from parent components to children components as immutable values. As JavaScript objects, these immutable values to update the components through their render functions each time the properties change. 
 **Features a Virtual DOM**
 ReactJS further features a virtual document object model (DOM) that makes it different from other front-end web frameworks. It uses virtual DOM to create an in-memory data structure. The in-memory data structure keeps track of the changes and updates the web browser&rsquo;s display DOM accordingly. The virtual DOM further enables programmers to keep writing code as the modified subcomponents are rendered by React libraries. 
 **Faster than Other Frontend Web Frameworks**
 ReactJS is designed as a simple and lightweight JavaScript library. It lacks some of the robust features provided by other JavaScript web frameworks. For instance, React does not come with any built-in features to facilitate dependency injection. The developers have to use third-party modules or libraries to inject dependencies. The lack of additional features makes React lighter and faster than other frontend web frameworks. Facebook has further included several features in React to make it outperform other JavaScript frameworks. 
 **Keeps Web Applications Testable** 
 The users nowadays access a website on varying devices, platforms, and browsers. Hence, it becomes essential for testers to evaluate web applications thoroughly by performing and repeating a variety of software testing methods. ReactJS simplifies web application testing by enabling developers to keep the applications testable. While testing a ReactJS application, the testers can treat and manipulate React views as functions of the state. They can even assess output by triggering various functions, actions, and events. 
 **Facilitates Mobile App Development** 
 In 2015, Facebook released React Native to enable programmers to write iOS, Android, and Windows mobile apps in JavaScript. React Native enables programmers to build platform-specific mobile apps by leveraging the React architecture. Like React, React Native also focuses on reusable components and code reusability. But it manipulates DOM through native views. The code reusability support makes it easier for developers to reuse the same UI components across web applications and mobile apps. 
 **Easy to Learn, Use, and Extend** 
 Unlike other web frameworks, React does not require beginners to learn any domain specific language. Any programmers familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript can use ReactJS to create a variety of UI components. At the same time, the developers also have the option to use ReactJS in a number of ways. They can use React on both client-side and server-side. Likewise, they can use React as the view layer in MVC for web applications and mobile apps. Also, they can extend React by integrating it with a variety of third-party libraries and web frameworks. 
 **Keeps Evolving** 
 Despite being an open source JavaScript library, ReactJS is being supported by large tech enterprises like Facebook and Instagram. Hence, it has been evolving consistently to help developers to build better and modern UIs. The information posted on a number of websites indicates that the ReactJS team is currently working on introducing new render types, enhancing server-side rendering, and improving error handling. Hence, the upcoming version of ReactJS will help developers to overcome some of its major shortcomings. 
 
 At present, ReactJS is one of the most preferred client-side web development tools. It is being used by a number of high-traffic websites including Facebook, Instagram, Airbnb, Netflix, DropBox and WhatsApp. But the developers must remember that ReactJS, like other web development tools, has its own shortcomings. For instance, ReactJS is developed as a simple JavaScript library and covers only the view layer of the web application.
