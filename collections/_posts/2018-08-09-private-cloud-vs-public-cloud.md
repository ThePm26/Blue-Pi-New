# Private Cloud vs. Public Cloud
<p> Most enterprises nowadays adopt cloud computing to store data and run applications without building and maintaining on-premise IT infrastructure. The enterprises even have the option to deploy cloud computing in a number of ways. The cloud computing deployment models can be divided into two broad categories &ndash; public cloud and private cloud. An enterprise can opt for private cloud to avail and use computing resources exclusively through dedicated hardware, software, and network.</p>
<p> On the other hand, the enterprise has to share computing resources with other subscribers when it opts for public cloud. The public <a href="https://www.bluepiit.com/migration">cloud service provider</a> will make hardware, software, and support infrastructure available to the business. But the business has to share the hardware, software, storage device, and network with other tenants. Hence, it becomes essential for enterprises to understand the major differences between private cloud and public cloud. </p>
<h2> Comparing Commonly Used Cloud Deployment Models: Private Cloud vs. Public Cloud </h2>
<p><b> Tenancy and Exposure </b></p>
<p> The private cloud services can be accessed and used by a single organization. On the other hand, multiple cloud tenants can use the same public cloud services. Likewise, private cloud enables enterprises to store all data their data in a dedicated storage device that cannot be accessed by others. But the public cloud service providers store data from multiple organizations in a shared infrastructure. </p>
<p><b> Data Center Location</b></p>
<p> When an enterprise opts for public cloud, it lacks the option to decide the location of the data center. It has to store all its data in the data center provided by the cloud service provider. The location of the database may even differ according to the location of public cloud infrastructure. But an enterprise can choose the data center location by opting for private cloud. Private cloud services even allow businesses to store their data on either on-premise data centers or the infrastructure provided by the cloud service provider. </p>
<p><b> Hardware and Software Components </b></p>
<p> The public clouds enable businesses to run their applications smoothly without investing in additional software and hardware components. The subscribers can run their software applications efficiently by paying only for the services and computing resources used by them. But an enterprise has to invest in specific hardware components to leverage private cloud services fully. For instance, a business can store its data more securely and run its applications more efficiently by hosting the cloud infrastructure on physical servers. </p>
<p><b> Cloud Service Management </b></p>
<p> The public cloud service providers maintain, manage, and update the cloud infrastructure without involving the subscribers. The option helps businesses to manage and update cloud services without deploying dedicated administrators and incurring additional expenses. On the other hand, an enterprise has to deploy a dedicated administrator to maintain and manage private cloud services. It even has to incur additional expenses to manage the cloud infrastructures and services efficiently. </p>
<p><b> Flexibility </b></p>
<p> Public clouds require businesses to share hardware, storage, and networks with other subscribers. Hence, the enterprises lack the option to customize the cloud infrastructure according to their precise needs. On the other hand, private clouds enable businesses to customize the cloud infrastructure according to their precise needs without any restrictions. Hence, private cloud is considered to be more flexible than public cloud. </p>
<p><b> Security</b></p>
<p> As noted earlier, an enterprise has to share hardware, storage, and networks with other cloud tenants when it opts for public cloud. It also has to rely on the security tools and services provided by the cloud service providers to protect the applications and data. But private cloud services enable businesses to keep the applications and data secured by accessing computing resources exclusively. They even have the option to implement higher levels of security and authentication. </p>
<p><b> Scalability </b></p>
<p> Both private and public clouds provide optimal scalability to enterprises. The public clouds enable businesses to avail on-demand computing resources according to their current needs. The leading cloud service providers even build a wider network of servers to enhance resource availability and prevent failures. At the same time, private clouds also enable enterprises to avail computing resources on demand without any restrictions and delays.</p>
<p><b> Cost </b></p>
<p> Many enterprises prefer public cloud to private cloud to reduce cloud deployment cost. Unlike private clouds, public clouds do not require businesses to purchase software and hardware components and manage the cloud infrastructure. But private clouds require businesses to set up on-premise data centers and deploy dedicated administrators. Hence, many enterprises opt for public cloud to avail computing resources simply by paying for the services they use.</p>
<p> On the whole, private cloud and public cloud differ from each other in a number of aspects. But the enterprises still have the option to bridge the gap between the two commonly used cloud deployment models by opting for hybrid cloud. The hybrid cloud services are distributed across both private clouds and public clouds. An enterprise can deploy sensitive applications in the private cloud and host other services on the infrastructure provided by the cloud service provider. They can even interchange private cloud and public cloud according to their current requirements.</p>
