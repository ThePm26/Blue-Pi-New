# Life of BluePi
<p>Clocking a 100% growth in revenues every year is no joke!</p>
<p>More so, if you&rsquo;re a self-funded, lean company, working on cutting-edge technologies, partnering with some high-profile names and helping clients across multiple industries to solve complex business problems.<br />
With an 80-member strong team, looking to grow 3-fold, and with global expansions, new offices and rapid growth, on the cards; 2017 is going to be a watershed year for us, without a doubt. But, all those won&rsquo;t come on a platter. We need to make some conscious calls and get them right &ndash; throughout the next 12 months, and that&rsquo;s not going to be smooth sailing for sure!</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why starting this year on a high note was crucial. It sets us up on the best possible course for success. What better way to do this, than giving ourselves a corporate makeover &ndash; with a brand-new website, fresh content, and imagery. But that&rsquo;s not enough, we&rsquo;ve done well to back it up with great substance. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Some inspiring partnerships</h3>
</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>We&rsquo;re now Advanced Consulting Partners for AWS Cloud for Cloud Services. The Microsoft partnership was kick-started by Mr. Ralph Haupter, President, Microsoft Asia, who visited our Gurgaon office and appreciated the good work we&rsquo;ve been putting in. Exciting partnerships with Cloudera, Pivotal, etc. are on the cards as well.</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>A 4-Pillar Strategy</h3>
</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>We&rsquo;ve re-arranged our businesses into 4 key areas:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>Cloud Services</li>
<li>App Development</li>
<li>Big Data &amp; Analytics</li>
</ul>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>These are not just niche and exciting but are crucial for any business serious about making a difference and gaining a competitive edge in today&rsquo;s world.</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>A Global Outlook</h3>
</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been mostly serving Indian clients hitherto, but with a renewed focus, backed by a strong expertise, we&rsquo;re all set to go global.</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>What&rsquo;s a consulting company without a great team?</h3>
</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>With our Bangalore and Gurgaon offices bustling with activity, housing an 80-member team with diverse skill sets and backgrounds, Life of BluePi has surely hit some exciting turns!</p>
<p>Charity begins at home. So, we asked ourselves, what are the best adjectives that describe BluePi, and it came to us as no surprise that <strong><em>Futuristic</em></strong>, <strong><em>Enthusiastic</em></strong> and <strong><em>Reliable</em></strong> were the chosen ones. I&rsquo;ve always felt we&rsquo;re futuristic enough to spot the next big wave in technology. Having started a company thriving on cloud and big data - much before they became the trends that they are - is a perfect testimony to this. And you can&rsquo;t go the distance if you are not reliable. Thanks to the reliability with which we have been delivering projects, our clients are ready to swear by us if there is a problem that needs solving. And then, finally, without being enthusiastic about what we&rsquo;re doing, we could have never come this far! Day-in and Day-out, solving real-world problems using technology is what motivates us and keeps us going.<br />
Our brand-new website embodies these very values &ndash; everything from the fonts used, the refreshed logo, the colours, the content. We&rsquo;ve kept it conversational and earnest &ndash; we don&rsquo;t want it to be over the top or pushy in any sense. So, <a href="https://www.bluepiit.com/">come around to our website</a>, give it a whirl, and do not forget to give us your valuable inputs. We&rsquo;re all set to <strong><em>Imagineer transformed tomorrows</em></strong>, and we welcome you aboard!</p>
