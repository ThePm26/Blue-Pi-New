# Customer Data Platform
{% picture "{{relative_url}}/assets/images/blog/cdp.png" --img class="blog_hero_img" --alt cdp %}
## WHAT IS CDP?
The term CDP stands for Customer Data Platform. CDP is defined as a packaged software that centralizes customer data from all sources and then makes this data available to other systems for marketing campaigns, customer service and all customer experience initiatives.

The types of data a CDP can work with include:

*   **Events:**  
Events comprise of behavioral data that arises from a user’s actions in a session on a website, in an app, or on a mobile browser.
*   **Customer attributes:**  
Customer attributes include names, addresses, contact details, birthdays, etc. Advanced CDPs can also store machine-learning powered predictions, such as likelihood to purchase.
*   **Transactional data:**  
Transactional data is for purchases, returns, and other info from e-commerce or POS systems.
*   **Campaign metrics:**  
Campaign metrics gather engagement, reach, impressions, and other metrics from campaigns.
*   **Customer service data:**  
Customer service data is for data like live chat data, number and length of interactions, frequency, NPS scores, other data from CRM systems.


## What is not a customer data platform?

There are many solutions that might create confusion between customer data platforms and other similar solutions. Some key points on how to distinguish differences between cdp and and other tools.



*   CDP is not a CRM (Customer Relationship Managers). CRM’s are designed to interact with clients and create profiles of them, but the main difference is, they work with limited data sources. CRM usually focuses on the identifiable personal data, on the other hand CDP usually contains data around cookie identifiers/devices. 

*   A customer data platform is not a customer integration tool, CDPs are designed specifically for marketing and contains features like database creation and management, business intelligence, analytics and more.

*   A customer data platform is not a Delivery Platform. For example the web page, social network management platforms, etc are not part of the CDP, but interact with it to send messages and collect data.

*   A customer data platform is not a DMP (data management platform).
DMP focuses more on anonymous segments and categories than on individual users, and usually the information they contain expires after the cookie's lifetime. And CDPs create persistent client profiles in a single record for each user.

*   A customer data platform is not a data warehouse. Normally, [data warehouses](https://www.bluepiit.com/blog/deep-diving-in-the-world-of-data-warehousing-continued/) are created and managed by IT teams. In contrast, CDPs are designed so that the data is easily accessible anduseful to the marketing team.

## **Key Benefits of Customer Data Platforms**
