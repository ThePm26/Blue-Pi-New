# Big Data Analytics
<p> Most enterprises nowadays collect large and varied datasets &ndash; <a href="https://www.bluepiit.com/big-data">Big Data</a> &ndash; from diverse sources. But no enterprise can leverage big data fully without analyzing the structured and unstructured data accurately and draw conclusions about the data timely. The processing and analysis of big data is essential for making informed business decisions at the right time.</p>
<p> As a form of advanced analytics, big data analytics help businesses to analyze a large amount of data proactively and uncover hidden patterns and correlations immediately. Unlike conventional business intelligence (BI) solutions, big data analytics simplify and accelerate analysis of large volumes of structured and unstructured data using statistical algorithms, predictive models, and what-if analysis. </p>
<p> The businesses even have the option to choose from a wide range of tools for big data analysis. These big data analytics solutions come with built-in features to uncover useful information, facilitate decision making, and suggest conclusions by organizing, cleaning, inspecting, transforming and modeling big data. That is why; it becomes essential for enterprises to understand important aspects of big data analytics.</p>
<h2> Understanding Important Aspects of Big Data Analytics </h2>
