# Amazon AWS vs. Alibaba Cloud
<p> At present, Amazon Web Services (AWS) dominates the worldwide public cloud infrastructure platforms by <a href="https://www.skyhighnetworks.com/cloud-security-blog/microsoft-azure-closes-iaas-adoption-gap-with-amazon-aws/"> holding 41.5% of application workload</a>. But several public cloud platforms have been growing consistently in terms of revenue and market penetration. Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun) recently <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/07/13/how-much-will-cloud-computing-contribute-to-alibabas-top-line-growth/">reported consistent triple-digit revenue growth </a>. AWS is launched by Amazon.com as an on-demand cloud computing platform for individuals, businesses, and government.</p>
<p> At the same time, Aliyun is part of China&rsquo;s biggest online commerce company &ndash; Alibaba.com. Despite the triple-digit revenue growth, Aliyun&rsquo;s worldwide Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) stands around 3% in comparison to 44% of AWS. However, no business should pick a public cloud platform only based on its market share or adoption rate. They must compare AWS and Aliyun based on a number of metrics to move their applications and data to the right public cloud platform. </p>
<h2> Amazon Web Services (AWS) vs. Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun)</h2>
<p><b>Operations</b></p>
<p> Amazon launched AWS as an on-demand cloud computing platform in 2006. On the other hand, Alibaba Cloud was founded in 2009. Initially, Aliyun was providing cloud solutions and services only in China. At present, AWS holds a leadership position in several developed and emerging markets. Alibaba has been expanding Aliyun continuously by setting up new data centers and forming partnerships. But AWS still dominates the worldwide public cloud market by operating in more countries than Aliyun. </p>
<p><b>Data Center Regions</b></p>
<p> Both AWS and Aliyun have been expanding their data center regions consistently. AWS Cloud currently operates across 57 availability zones located in 19 different regions. Amazon has revealed its plan to add another 15 availability zones to the existing AWS infrastructure in near future. On the other hand, Aliyun currently operates in 42 availability zones and 18 data center regions in the world. However, Alibaba has been expanding Aliyun infrastructure consistently by adding new availability zones. </p>
<p><b>Subscription Plans</b></p>
<p> Both AWS and Aliyun allows users to choose from multiple subscription plans.AWS allows users to access Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud as a web service based 4 distinct plans. Likewise, Alibaba Cloud also allows users to choose from 3 different plans. The subscription plans differ from each other in terms of memory, disk space, data transfer, CPU cores, virtualization, and cost. Hence, the subscribers need to compare the subscription plans according to their precise needs and budget. </p>
<p><b>Data and Cloud Security</b></p>
<p> In addition to launching new cloud solutions and services, Amazon focuses extensively on AWS security. It enables users to keep their applications and data secure using a variety of identity, compliance, and security products. The users can leverage these products to monitor and evaluate the security of their cloud infrastructure continuously. At the same time, Aliyun protects web applications by implementing robust anti-DDoS technology. The users even have the option to integrate the anti-DDoS protection into ECS instances. </p>
<p><b>Performance</b></p>
<p> The subscribers must compare the performance of AWS and Aliyun to run their applications optimally in the cloud. The <a href="https://www.vpsbenchmarks.com/compare/alibaba_vs_ec2">performance of each public cloud platform </a> differs across subscription plans. AWS beats Aliyun in the category of web response time. Also, AWS accelerates uploads and downloads by delivering higher network download speed than Aliyun. It is always important for subscribers to compare the performance of these public cloud platforms based on studies conducted under varying user conditions. </p>
<p><b>Pricing</b></p>
<p> Amazon requires subscribers to consume compute services through Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2). Likewise, Alibaba Cloud delivers compute service through Elastic Compute Service (ECS). Both EC2 and ECS allow users to choose from many instance types. Also, both support virtual and bare-metal servers. Hence, the cost of AWS and Aliyun differs according to the specific instance types. The prices of individual instance types also differ. Both EC2 and ECS further allow subscribers to choose from similar storage options, computing resources, and cloud services. Hence, the users need to keep in their precise computing resource requirement while comparing cloud computing cost. </p>
<p><b> Free Trial </b></p>
<p> Both AWS and Aliyun allow subscribers to use and assess cloud solutions and services on a trial basis. Alibaba Cloud currently allows subscribers to choose from 16 free trial products and over 20 always free products. The subscribers even have the option to assess the quality of elastic computing, storage, databases and application services. At the same time, Amazon allows subscribers to use and assess its cloud platform, products, and services through AWS free tier. The users even have an option to choose from several always free, trial, and 12 months free AWS solutions and services.</p>
<p> Many analysts believe that Alibaba Cloud has the potential to disrupt AWS Cloud in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) in near future. Also, Alibaba has been setting up new data centers and forming strategic partnerships to growing Aliyun&rsquo;s US presence. But AWS still dominates the worldwide IaaS market with a share of 44%. Hence, Alibaba Cloud will need more time to compete with market leaders like AWS.</p>
