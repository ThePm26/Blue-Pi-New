# Business Intelligence in Consumer Goods
<p>With a huge boom in the e-commerce industry, the customer is well-informed and has infinite options available under his thumb. Although, Aggregator apps help in increasing business visibility but also add to the cut-throat competition and this leaves the 'Consumer Goods Providers' to rely on consumer&rsquo;s tendency to &lsquo;pull&rsquo; products.<br />
With ever-changing shopping trends and ever-increasing data, analytics comes as the only resort to find a way out of this maze.<br />
Now let&rsquo;s think of a situation, where business wants to identify the right price and discount point that maximizes sales lift and RoI. There are number of data points needed to figure this out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historical Sales Data</li>
<li>CRM Data</li>
<li>Historical Promotional Data</li>
<li>Inventory Data</li>
</ul>
<p>Every business stores this data in some form or manner, but data itself pose a bigger challenge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data is huge</li>
<li>Data is heterogeneous</li>
<li>Data needs to be accessed from all across</li>
<li>Data is noisy</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the company hops onto this roller coaster, the ride is full of jerks, starting from setting up the process till getting the fruitful results out. That&rsquo;s where building a Business Intelligence solution helps:</p>
<ul>
<li>BI solution can answer the questions that matters the most for business like:</li>
<li>What pricing and promotional strategy is most effective?</li>
<li>Which floor plan will sell more designer apparels?</li>
<li>When and how much to discount?</li>
</ul>
<p>BI solutions are divided into various parts:</p>
<h3>ETL</h3>
<ul>
<li>Used to collate data from different sources</li>
<li>Extract, Cleanse and Transform data to get useful insights</li>
<li>Load transformed data in data warehouse</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data WareHouse</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bluepiit.com/blog/deep-diving-in-the-world-of-data-warehousing/">Data Warehouse</a>:This is where the data resides</li>
<li>Number of views can be built depending upon the insight of end user&rsquo;s interest. This is what makes OLAP systems different from OLTP, where OLAP is targeted to find the collective effect, while OLTP concentrates on transactional details</li>
<li>Data security in order to protect the data from unauthorized access</li>
</ul>
<h3>Visualization</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reports, graphs to clearly identify the trends and patterns</li>
<li>Views specific to user groups and departments with restricted access</li>
</ul>
<p>As per the latest survey, 85% of CIOs emphasize on BI solutions, while planning for IT Budget which signifies the importance for business to embark on the journey now.<br />
