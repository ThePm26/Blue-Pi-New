# The State of Java in 2019
<p> According to <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/"> TIOBE Programming Community Index for January 2019</a>, Java is currently more popular than other widely used programming languages including Python, C, C++, Visual Basic .NET, C# and JavaScript. Also, for almost 20 years, C, C++ and Java are consistently in the top 3, far ahead of the rest of the pack. </p>
<p> The ratings depict the relevance and popularity of Java in 2019. Like other general purpose programming languages, Java is currently used by developers for creating a variety of desktop GUI applications, websites, and web applications. But Java is one of the two official programming languages for the world&rsquo;s most popular mobile operating system &ndash; Android. </p>
<p> Also, it is one of the mature programming languages which are being used by the Internet of Things (IoT) projects, big data solutions, real-time applications, and machine learning solutions. Oracle further keeps Java relevant by rolling out a new version of the programming language every six months. There are also a number of reasons why the massive popularity of Java will remain intact in 2019. </p>
<h2> Assessing State of Java Programming Language in 2019 </h2>
<p><b> Next Version of Java </b></p>
<p> Oracle rolls out new versions of Java at regular intervals. In October 2018, the company released Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 with several new features, deprecated features, and enhancements. Software developers have been switching to Java 11 to avail new features like support for support for Unicode 10.0.0, 16018 new characters, 10 new scripts, and 18 new blocks, Java string methods and local variable syntax for lambda expressions. Oracle will roll out Java 12 in 2019 with several new features and enhancements. But the developers will lack the option to download Oracle JDK free of cost. </p>
<p><b> Android App Development </b></p>
<p>  Google allows mobile app developers to choose from two official programming languages for Android &ndash; Java and Kotlin. Unlike Java, Kotlin is a modern programming language. In addition to addressing the major shortcomings of Java, Kotlin also comes with native features to simplify Android app development. But many Android app developers still prefer Java to Kotlin. Also, Java is fully interoperable with Kotlin. The massive worldwide mobile operating system market share of Android will keep Java relevant for mobile app developers in 2019. </p>
<p><b> Development of Applications for Embedded Devices </b></p>
<p> Java is one of the programming languages that come with native embedding computing capabilities. The capabilities make Java one of the widely programming languages for the development of apps for various embedded systems. Java ME further makes it easier for programmers to write software for devices and systems with constrained memory by supporting a wide range of mobile and embedded devices. The Real-time Specification for Java (RTSJ) will make it easier for programmers to build custom applications for embedded systems by addressing issues related to language and runtime. </p>
<p><b> Internet of Things Projects </b></p>
<p> Java is currently one of the most preferred programming languages for IoT projects. Java further facilitates IoT application development through Project Jigsaw. Project Jigsaw enables developers to make Java compatible with small and portable devices without sacrificing its core capabilities and sophisticated features. The implementation of the design and standard module system recommended by Project Jigsaw will help programmers to write custom IoT solutions in Java. Also, the developers can use a Java ME platform to build secure enterprise mobile apps for IoT. </p>
<p><b> Development of Custom Big Data Solutions </b></p>
<p>  Many enterprises these days build custom big data solutions to collect, store, manage, process, and analyze massive amounts of data efficiently. Java does not come with any built-in features to facilitate the development of custom big data solutions. But the developers can simplify and accelerate big data solution development by leveraging a wide range of Java-based frameworks and tools including Hadoop, ElasticSearch, HBase and Accumulo. The tools and frameworks contribute hugely towards making Java one of the most preferred programming languages for big data initiatives. </p>
<p><b> Development of Real-Time Applications </b></p>
<p> The enterprises make various mobile devices and industrial equipment deliver relevant information and accurate results using real-time software. Java SE API makes it easier for developers to build real-time software for various enterprise systems that deliver results under stringent timing constraints. The Real-Time Specification for Java emphasizes on simplifying implementation of real-time systems using Java SE API. Hence, developers will keep using Java for building a variety of real-time applications. </p>
<p> Java will remain one of the most widely used programming languages in 2019. But the Java trends will keep changing throughout the current year. The developers need to monitor and adopt the emerging Java trends to build various applications efficiently and rapidly. Some of these trends will continue towards making Java more popular than other programming languages. </p>
