# Web Application Development Best Practices
<p> There was a time when websites were adequate to improve a business's online presence. But a large percentage of users nowadays access websites and web applications on their smartphones and tablets. A number of studies even suggest that users spend most of their digital media time in mobile apps.</p>
<p> To strengthen their online presence, the businesses nowadays need websites that deliver optimal user experience across devices, platforms, and browsers. At the same time, enterprises need to improve user engagement and prevent user abandonment by making these websites stand out in the crowd. </p>
<p>The enterprises must focus on various aspects of web applications &ndash; accessibility, functionality, performance, usability, security, and searchability - to optimize the user experience. At the same time, they must implement a number of web development best practices to build websites that meet precise business requirements and deliver the optimal user experience.</p>
<h2>Best Practices for Developing Web Applications that Standout in the Crowd</h2>
<p><b>Keep Websites Responsive</b></p>
<p> Responsive web design enables developers to build web applications with a single codebase by combining HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The single codebase makes it easier for programmers to accelerate the development and maintenance of custom web applications. At the same time,  responsive web design will make the same website look good on both computers and mobile devices. An enterprise can easily improve the web application&rsquo;s accessibility, user experience, and search engine visibility by adopting responsive web design.</p>
<p><b>Build Progressive Web App</b></p>
<p> Progressive web apps help enterprises to bridge the gap between web applications and native mobile apps. The new generation apps are developed with commonly used web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. But it delivers native ape-like personalized user experience by accessing the native features of the underlying mobile platform and device. Google even recommends enterprises to improve conversion rates by building a progressive web app. </p>
<p><b>Make the Website Load Faster</b></p>
<p> Many users nowadays abandon websites that do not load in 3 seconds. Also, Google considers loading speed as a key metric to rank websites. Hence, enterprises must speed up their web applications to get organic traffic and prevent user abandonment. They must test the loading speed of each web page. Likewise, they can make the website load faster by compressing images, implementing caching, compressing front-end resources, and implementing content delivery networks (CDNs). </p>
<p><b>Integrate a Robust CMS</b></p>
<p> No enterprise can increase conversion rate without updating and managing the website's digital content efficiently. The content management systems (CMS) enable the administrator to control and manage digital content quickly and efficiently. The features and tools provided by the CMS even help an administrator to change the website&rsquo;s look, feel, content, and functionality on the fly. The enterprises can easily manage the website content in the future by integrating a CMS with the website at the time of development. </p>
<p><b>Use Impactful Typography</b></p>
<p> At present, web design is synonymous with typography. A good typography style contributes immensely towards making the website look distinct and leave a long-lasting impact on visitors. A number of studies even suggest that typography impacts users' mood and perception. The designers must experiment with various web typography and pick the one that makes the website stand out in the crowd. </p>
<p><b>Leverage Web Animations</b></p>
<p> At present, animated data visualization and 3D data representations are the hottest trends in web application development. Many high-traffic websites nowadays leverage web animations to present complex information in a simple and engaging way through storytelling. The enterprises can easily boost the web applications' user experience by telling stories through animations. The animations will further help businesses to leverage virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies in the future. </p>
<p><b>Use Chatbots as Customer Support Executives</b></p>
<p> Chatbots are currently one of the hottest trends in web application development. Unlike conventional software programs, chatbots have the capability to interact with website visitors through both textual and auditory methods. While developing websites, the business must leverage chatbots as virtual customer executives to resolve customer queries proactively and facilitate lead generation. Enterprises can even use custom chatbots to accomplish specific tasks. </p>
<p><b>Don&rsquo;t Ignore the Latest Search Engine Guidelines</b></p>
<p> Major search engines like Google and Bing frequently update their search algorithm to deliver relevant and updated search results. No enterprise can divert regular traffic to its website without adhering to the latest search engine guidelines. For instance, Google recommends website owners to increase their website&rsquo;s search engine visibility by improving their loading speed, mobile-friendliness, and content originality. The enterprises must implement the latest search engine guidelines while developing websites to avoid expensive SEO campaigns. </p>
<p><b>Focus on the Web Application's Built-in Security Features</b></p>
<p> No enterprise can improve its website&rsquo;s user experience without address security and privacy issues. It must use the latest encryption mechanism to keep both user and corporate data secure. Also, it must eliminate all security vulnerabilities in the website to prevent a variety of targeted security attacks. At the same time, the businesses must perform elaborate security and penetration testing before deploying the website. </p>
<p><b>Switch to AI-Driven Web Development Tools</b></p>
<p> Several studies highlight the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies to transform the way web applications are planned and developed. An enterprise can easily build futuristic websites and web applications by leveraging AI frameworks and APIs. It can even use AI-driven web development tools to build next-generation web applications by analyzing competition and understanding emerging trends. </p>
<p><b>Use Cloud-based Web Development IDEs</b></p>
<p> The cloud technologies enable enterprises to develop, test and deploy web applications efficiently without setting up an on-premise IT infrastructure. The businesses can further leverage the cloud-based web development tools to build custom web applications rapidly. The enterprises must consider switching from conventional desktop-based development tools to cloud-based IDEs like Cloud 9, Cloud IDE, Codeanywhere, Kodingen, and Sourcekit. </p>
<p> On the whole, the enterprises must adopt a number of best practices to launch outstanding websites. They must focus on user experience throughout the software development lifecycle to strengthen their online presence. But they must remember that the trends in web application development keep changing from time to time. Hence, the enterprises must fine-tune the best practices according to the latest web application development trends. </p>
