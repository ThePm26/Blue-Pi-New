# Private Cloud vs. On-Premises
<p> Businesses nowadays deploy their applications/services in two distinct environments &ndash; on-premises and cloud. When an enterprise opts for on-premises, the software will run on and the data will be stored in infrastructure located within its premises. It needs to create, upgrade, and scale the on-premise IT infrastructure by investing in sophisticated hardware, compatible software, and robust services. Also, the business needs to deploy dedicated IT staff to upkeep, scale, and manage the on-premise infrastructure continuously.</p>
<p> On the other hand, cloud computing enables businesses to deploy, upkeep, and run applications/services without creating and maintaining on-premise IT infrastructure. The cloud computing models allow businesses to avail of computing resources on demand based on pay-as-you-use-pricing. The businesses even have the option to choose from three distinct models of cloud computing &ndash; private, public, and hybrid. Private cloud helps businesses to deploy and run their applications/services in a dedicated and secure cloud-based environment. </p>
<p> Unlike, a public cloud, private cloud enables businesses to avail IT services that are provisioned and customized according to their precise needs. The business can further avail the IT services in a secure and reliable way over a private IT infrastructure. A number of studies suggest that most businesses nowadays prefer private cloud to on-premises. Also, many enterprises have been migrating their applications and data from on-premises to private cloud.</p>
<p> It is always important for businesses to keep in mind the major differences between private cloud and on-premises to deploy their applications and services on the right IT infrastructure.</p>
<h2> Comparing Two Application Deployment Environments: Private Cloud vs. On-Premises </h2>
<p><b> Setup and Configuration </b></p>
<p> When a business opts for on-premises, it needs to create a robust IT infrastructure by investing the right hardware, software, servers, and data storage systems. It further needs to deploy skilled technicians to set up and evaluate the on-premise IT infrastructure based on precise business needs. Often enterprises find it challenging to keep the on-premise IT infrastructure despite deploying sufficient resources.</p>
<p> On the other hand, private cloud helps businesses to deploy their applications and services on a flexible IT infrastructure without investing in specific hardware, software, and servers. The businesses even have the option to choose from hosted private cloud and on-premise/internal private cloud. The hosted private cloud is deployed in the business premises and managed by enterprises internally. The hosted private cloud solutions are provided and managed by third-party services.</p>
<p><b> Infrastructure Management </b></p>
<p> When a business opts for on-premises, it needs to explore ways to upkeep and optimize the onsite IT infrastructure continuously. In addition to extending the hardware and upgrading the software, the business also needs to focus on managing servers efficiently. It needs to deploy dedicated technicians to configure, upkeep, scale, and upgrade the servers. Hence, on-premises require businesses to deploy additional resources for infrastructure management.</p>
<p> Both on-premise private cloud and hosted private cloud are more flexible than on-premises. Like on-premises, internal private cloud requires businesses to implement a robust infrastructure management plan to control and manage computing resources efficiently. The infrastructure management plan further needs to focus on server management. But hosted private cloud enables businesses to run application and services on web infrastructure managed by third-party service providers. Hence, it becomes easier for businesses to scale, upkeep, and secure servers without deploying additional resources.</p>
<p><b> Resource Scalability </b></p>
<p> No business can upscale or downscale computing resources without making changes to its on-premise IT infrastructure. They need to invest in additional hardware, software, and servers to upscale the computing resources. The technicians further need additional time to upscale and downscale the computing resources by modifying or updating the existing onsite IT infrastructure. </p>
<p> Like on-premises, on-premise private cloud requires businesses to deploy additional resources to upscale computing resources. But the hosted private cloud enables businesses to avail computing resources and storage space on demand. The enterprises can enhance scalability by availing computing resources based on pay-as-you-use pricing according to their current needs. </p>
<p><b> Upfront and Ongoing Cost </b></p>
<p> Many businesses switch from on-premises to private cloud to avoid the need to build and maintain IT infrastructure. On-premises require businesses to invest a hefty sum of funds initially to procure the hardware, software, servers, and other equipment. Also, the businesses have to hire skilled technicians to set up the infrastructure and deploy dedicated technicians to upkeep and manage the onsite infrastructure. </p>
<p> The on-premise private cloud requires businesses to carry the burden on infrastructure cost and deploy dedicated technicians to manage the infrastructure. But hosted cloud solutions help businesses to curtail initial capital investment and ongoing operational expenses by avoiding the need to create, maintain, and secure the IT infrastructure. That is why; many enterprises prefer hosted private cloud to on-premise private cloud.</p>
<p> Enterprises from various regions and sectors these days prefer private cloud to on-premises. In addition to reducing IT infrastructure development and maintenance cost, private cloud also makes it easier for businesses to scale computing resources, enhance application accessibility, and reduce application downtime. But the decision makers must keep in mind the advantages and disadvantages of both private cloud and on-premises to deploy their application and services in the most appropriate environment.</p>
