# 5 Ways To Take Advantage of Private Cloud
<p> The <a href="https://www.bluepiit.com/migration"> cloud platforms</a> enable enterprises to run businesses smoothly without creating and maintaining on-premise IT infrastructure. Based on his requirements and budget, each business owner has the option to choose from private cloud and public cloud. Like a public cloud, private cloud also enables business owners to avoid building and maintaining on-premise IT infrastructure. But the private cloud, unlike public cloud, enables business owners to avail dedicated and exclusive infrastructure. The private cloud can also be hosted on either the enterprise&rsquo;s on-premise infrastructure or the data center of the cloud provider. But private cloud scores over the public cloud in categories of security, customization, resource management, and disaster protection. There are also a number of reasons why enterprises have been switching from public cloud to private cloud.</p>
<h2> 5 Reasons Why Smarter Entrepreneurs Prefer Private Cloud to Public Cloud </h2>
<ul><b> 1) Easy Customization </b></ul>
<p> Many enterprises switch from public cloud to private cloud to experience greater flexibility. Unlike a public cloud, private cloud enables enterprises to customize hardware and other resources according to individual workload. The enterprise can further make the resources required by each workload without contacting the cloud service provider. The flexibility makes it easier for entrepreneurs to make adequate resources available to each application and deploy new applications without any delay. At the same time, private cloud also enables entrepreneurs to control users, data, and information without any restriction. </p>
<ul><b> 2) Secure Environment </b></ul>
<p> Nowadays, each web application or mobile app is vulnerable to a variety of targeted security attacks. The entrepreneur has to explore ways to keep both customer data and business data inaccessible to keep his business&rsquo;s credibility and reputation intact. Unlike the public cloud, the private cloud does not require entrepreneurs to share resources with other users. As the cloud environment belongs to a single client, it becomes easier for the entrepreneur to protect the infrastructure and systems by installing a robust firewall, antivirus software, and internet security tools. Also, he can store both customer and business data more securely in private virtual servers. </p>
<ul><b> 3) Efficient Resource Management </b></ul>
<p> As noted before, the private cloud environment belongs exclusively to a single enterprise. The enterprise can configure the cloud infrastructure and manage resources without any restriction. An entrepreneur can improve the performance of its systems and applications significantly by managing the cloud resources efficiently. For instance, an entrepreneur can make his website handle huge user loads by configuring additional servers or deploying extra virtual servers rapidly. He can even reduce private cloud computing cost significantly by managing the cloud resources efficiently. </p>
<ul><b> 4) Prevent Downtime </b></ul>
<p> Often website or mobile app downtime makes an enterprise lose huge sales revenues. Many entrepreneurs opt for private cloud to prevent downtime. A business owner can easily prevent downtime by configuring the cloud environment properly. For instance, he can easily increase website or mobile app uptime by shifting the virtual server automatically to a second physical server when the main server is being maintained or upgraded. Likewise, he can easily improve network performance and keep applications functional as the private cloud is deployed in the enterprise&rsquo;s intranet firewall. </p>
<ul><b> 5) Improved Disaster Protection </b></ul>
<p> In addition to preventing website or mobile app downtime, private cloud also helps enterprises to accelerate disaster protection. A business owner can improve disaster protecting significantly by connecting private cloud servers to storage area networks (SANs). The connectivity will automatically balance user load through multiple servers. Also, it will shift the private clouds from one server to another whenever any problem occurs in the main server. An entrepreneur can further optimize disaster protection by deploying multiple SANs across cloud infrastructure and data centers. </p>
<p> On the whole, a business owner can manage its business processes and operations more efficiently by switching from public cloud to private cloud. But many entrepreneurs still opt for public cloud platforms to save money. But private cloud helps enterprises to save money by availing hardware, network, and infrastructure provided and managed by the cloud service provider. Also, an enterprise can opt for private cloud to save money by avoiding maintaining, upgrading, and troubleshoot its IT infrastructure regularly. </p>
