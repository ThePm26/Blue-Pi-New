BluePi team worked with us on an ambitious and so-called Blitz-Migration project,of moving our web services to Amazon Public Cloud. The team was agile enough
to not only learn our tech stack but also quickly got culturally aligned with our teams to work in an environment of high speed with the promise of reliability.
BluePi teams tech-abilities and quick debugging skills were handy and ensured success to project.
