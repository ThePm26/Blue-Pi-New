### Team Culture -

We have an open culture that encourages opinions and feedback. I think the best way fo thinking about our culture is to look at the values we believe in:

- **Sustained excellence:** 
excellence is not a goal, but a journey. We are always in pursuit of finding better ways of doing things and not accepting the status quo.
- **Be creative; keep learning; innovate:**  
Without continuous learning, one would stagnate and would find it very hard to sustain in BluePi.
- **Challenge others to grow:** 
We do not train you to grow; we challenge you to grow. That means you are expected to perform at an increasingly higher level of competence with each project and each passing day.
- **Work because you want to, not because you have to:**
Without passion for what you do, you would find it very hard to grow or even sustain in BluePi.
- **Belief:** 
Belief in yourself and your team to prevail in the face of any challenge.
- **Team interest before individual interest:**
Either the team succeeds or fails, no individual alone can succeed without team success
