### Challenge

FNP has pioneered the concept of flowers and gifts in India, with more
than 350 stores across 120 cities in India. It is one of the few companies
in India which has leveraged technology successfully to carve out a
competitive edge.
Online e-commerce is the primary channel of sales for FNP and due to
COVID, the online sales have picked up even more. In normal times FNP
website and apps are visited by millions of users each month, generating
more than 5 million page views and of course during festivals like Rakhi
the traffic grows multi-fold. Apart from visits, customers are also
constantly engaged through marketing campaigns.
With a large portion of business online and multiple customer
touchpoints, it becomes imperative to understand user behaviour across
different channels. The deep understanding of user behaviour can then
be used to personalise messaging, build custom pricing and
personalizing user experience on digital assets thereby improving
conversion and helping retain the customer better.
FNP had been segmenting the users from an online interaction point of
view, which is great in identifying performance issues and optimising
the site. Such user segmentation limits the opportunities to influence
the user experience. An example of this would be that all users would
get the same campaign emails, SMSs and push notifications, leading to a
very high noise to signal ratio.
FNP wanted to create a customer 360-degree view consolidating
different customer touchpoints across website, apps, IVR, social media
and other marketing channels. The Customer view could then be further
utilised by downstream applications like CRM, marketing to run targeted
campaigns and provides useful inputs for other business teams as
well.

### Solution

BluePi implemented a holistic Customer Data Platform that housed data from
different sources such as CRM, push notification interaction, transaction data
and clickstream data from web and apps. The CDP implementation brought
data out of siloed systems and its impact would compound with time, as
team leverages AI/ML capabilities to implement more use cases.

What’s more, the CDP implementation started providing immediate benefits,
helping improve two most important key drivers:
- Personalized omni-channel communication for the customers, reducing
noise and ultimately improving customer experience
- Making marketing more efficient by providing insights into customer
behaviour.

### Business value delivered

Proof of the pie is in the pudding, with the CDP implementation the key
business metric that showed immediate improvement was a 3% revenue
increase through the “event-driven” marketing campaigns. These campaigns
target customers who have taken a particular action on the web, for example,
customers who searched for something but did not buy, similarly visitors who
have been coming on the site/app but have made no purchase.

### Technology deployed

The speed of implementation and impact on business was made possible by
impeccable services provided by AWS. These services make it a pain-free
experience to build world-class data platforms.
