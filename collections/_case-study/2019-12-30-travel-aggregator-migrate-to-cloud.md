### Customer Profile 
One of the largest online hotel and air-travel booking websites in India, it is also one of the highest ranked apps in Google Play, under Travel category. In 2015, their hotels-booking volumes grew 5x YoY, with 70% of them coming from their mobile app.

The key business differentiator for the client was to deliver the fastest and most trusted user experience, enabled by the fastest search, booking, payments, settlements and refund processes. All of that, built on top of enormous amount of data coming in from various sources, daily.

### Problem Statement 
Client used to host all its applications and workloads on a traditional data center, by purchasing and renting its systems and architecture. This posed a huge challenge in scaling the application during high traffic periods. Additionally, purchasing new servers and upgrading their configuration was proving to be time consuming and expensive. They were looking for a scalable solution that tackled the enormous traffic.

###  BluePiâ€™s Solution 
The first of our recommendations was to migrate their entire infrastructure to AWS. This was crucial, as it would help them leverage benefits like Auto Scale and On-Demand temporary infrastructure, to tackle high volumes upfront. It also let them make use of AWS managed services like RDS for Database, ElasticCache for Caching, ELB for Load-Balancing, EMR for Hadoop, etc., helping them enhance operational efficiency at optimal costs. In addition, with features like Elastic Load Balancing, the infrastructure can automatically take care of redundancy, armed with additional safety of an auto-failover mechanism.
