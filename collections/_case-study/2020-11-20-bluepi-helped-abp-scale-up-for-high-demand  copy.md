### Challenge

InfoDriveIndia has been running their application on private cloud where they have been facing process, scalability and monitoring/visibility issues. 

### Solution
We had done broadly four tasks to achieve our end goal
- Move the code to CodeCommit and setup automated deployment pipelines for all the environments. 
- Help the developers get application metrics to understand the core issues
- Right sizing the application instances based on load test and then setup auto scaled environments.
- Setup monitoring and alerts so that preventive actions can be taken to avoid downtime.


### Business value delivered
- The application is now running at 25% of the original sizing. 
- Zero Downtime deployments with code pipelines.
- Visibility into application and infrastructure metrics to understand the usage and behavior.



### Technology deployed

The AWS services we used in this particular case are:
- AWS EC2
- AWS S3
- AWS Code Pipeline
- AWS CloudWatch
- AWS SNS
