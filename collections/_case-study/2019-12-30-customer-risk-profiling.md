### Customer Profile 
Leading life insurance provider

### Problem Statement 
BFSI players often collect data from multiple data sources and struggle with collating the entire data to 
+ Get a 360-degree view of the customer 
+ Calculate their risk averseness. Understanding how risky is each customer is important to pitch them relevant products, detect frauds, etc.

### BluePi's Solution
+ BluePi has built a machine learning-based Customer Risk Profiling system.
+ The primary objective is achieved by segmenting customers as high risk, 
medium risk and low-risk customers based on parameters like demographics, education, health details, policy attributes, etc 
+ The data was stored on S3 and the algorithm being used to solve the problem was implemented and trained on EMR using that data 

### Value Added
The model helped client to: 
+ Propose the right solution to the customer based on his/her risk score
+ Run targeted marketing and outreach campaigns

### AWS Service used
EC2, S3, Redshift, EMR, Glue
