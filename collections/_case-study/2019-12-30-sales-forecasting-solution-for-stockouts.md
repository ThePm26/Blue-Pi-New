India’s Leading retail Chain with more than 270 stores

### Problem Statement 
In fast-moving consumer retail, overstocking and stock-outs lead to spiraling costs, reduced profits & customer churn. Primary reasons for these two problems are inaccurate planning due to unavailability of the data-driven solution and unaccounted external factors such as weather, holidays, economic situation, public events, etc.

### BluePi’s Solution 
BluePi has built a Sales Forecasting solution that reduces

+ Uncertainty in the inventory procurement
+ Overstocking & stock-outs

+ Reducing stock-outs and overstocking by at least 20%.
