Every data journey begins with collecting the data from multiple sources coming in varied formats. All organizations are nowadays trying to collect data from multiple different systems all scattered in multiple places. We help you agglomerate this dispersed data and data sources by building an ingestion tier using well designed pipelines tailored for your needs. We use open source frameworks like Spark, Storm, Flink, Kafka that gives us flexibility to design the solution without any constraints, deployable in any Cloud or even On-Prem.
