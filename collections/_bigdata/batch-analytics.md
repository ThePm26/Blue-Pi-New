In the era of real time streaming, there are tasks that are time consuming and requires time. For creating customer 360 degree/single customer view where every user in records is analyzed for the entirety of the duration when he is active. These tasks which require heavier processing compute and longer time are executed in a batch mode at defined frequency. We at BluePi design scalable and cost effective solutions for such heavy lifting.
