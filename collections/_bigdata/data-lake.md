Businesses today hold data in multiple different sources and structures. Every business unit operating within an organization has its own source of truth to its own independent analytics leading to discrepancies between the functions. We at BluePi solve this problem by collating all these sources with different structures and formats into a single destination and creating a single source of truth for all the business functions. Our business oriented approach of carefully designing the datalake helps Businesses achieve their desirable outcome in a short span of time.
